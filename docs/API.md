## `watch(resource)`

The `watch(resource)` API connects your component to a shared resource and manages the **Suspense** lifecycle. It can be called inside `if` statements, `for` loops, or after early returns.

```javascript
import { Suspense, watch, initWatch } from 'poteli'
import { myStore } from './my-store'

export props => {
  return (
  <Suspense>
    <Profile />
  </Suspense>
  )
}

const Profile = props => {
  // Suspension & Observation
  watch(resource)

  // Data Acquisition (Directly from the store)
  const data = myStore.get()

  return (<div>Name: {data.name}</div>)
}

//
const resource = initWatch((set) => {
  // side effects like subscribing to a store or fetching data
  const unsubscribe = myStore.subscribe(set)
  return unsubscribe
})

```

## `initWatch(initializer)`

A constructor to bridge external reactive sources to the engine's observer system. It ensures that the engine is notified whenever the underlying data changes.


### Guiding Principles & Responsibilities

The following rules must be observed:

* **Pure Getters**: `store.get()` must be a **pure function**.
* **No Side Effects**: Executing I/O operations or state updates inside `get()` is strictly prohibited.
* **Idempotency**: If `get()` is called multiple times without a state update, it must return the same value and perform no side effects. All side-effectful logic should be handled within the `initializer` function passed to `initWatch`.


* **Notification Responsibility**: It is the **resource's responsibility** to notify the engine when data changes.
* **Re-render Guarantee**: Side effects may be executed during an update, provided they are triggered through the listener registered in `initWatch`, which guarantees a re-render.
* **State Inconsistency**: Failing to notify the engine when the state changes leads to UI inconsistency and is considered a violation of these principles.
