# SSR Emotion for Astro

A natural and powerful Zero-Runtime CSS-in-JS solution, seamlessly integrated with Astro.

## 🚀 Why it matters

I used to think there wasn't much point in writing static content in JSX instead of just using `.astro` files. It seemed like standard `.astro` was more than enough for most cases.

However, I've realized one major advantage: "SSR EMOTION". While other frameworks often struggle with complex configurations to get Emotion working with SSR, Potate bridges this gap naturally. It allows you to use the power of CSS-in-JS without any of the typical performance trade-offs.

## 💎 The Result

* **Zero Runtime by default:** No `Emotion` library is shipped to the browser. It delivers a pure Zero-JS experience.
* **Familiar DX:** Use the full expressive power of the Emotion `css()` function that you already know.
* **Static by Default:** Styles are automatically extracted into static CSS during the Astro build process.
* **Performance:** No hydration overhead for styles and no Flash of Unstyled Content (FOUC).


## 🛠 How it looks

In Potate, you don't need to learn any special properties or complex setups. It just works with the standard `class` attribute and the Emotion `css()` function. It feels completely natural, even in Astro's **"No directive" (Server Only)** mode.

While you can use `css()` directly, you can also create reusable functions like `flexCol()` (which we call **"The Patterns"**).

```jsx
import { css } from '@emotion/css'

export const MyComponent = () => (
  <div class={flexCol({ 
    color: 'hotpink',
    '&:hover': { color: 'deeppink' }
  })}>
    Hello, SSR EMOTION!
  </div>
)

const flexCol = (...args) => css({
  display: 'flex',
  flexDirection: 'column',
}, ...args)

```

## 🌗 Hybrid Styling (SSR + CSR)

In Potate, Island components (`client:*`) get the best of both worlds.

### How it works

1. At Build Time (SSR): Potate executes your `css()` calls and extracts the initial styles into a static CSS file. This ensures your component looks perfect even before JavaScript loads.

2. At Runtime (Hydration): Once the Island hydrates in the browser, the Emotion runtime takes over.

### Why this is powerful

Because the Emotion runtime remains active inside Islands, you can use standard React/Preact patterns to handle dynamic styles without any special "Potate-specific" APIs.

### Example: Hydration-aware Styling

You can easily change styles when the component "wakes up" in the browser:

```jsx
export const InteractiveBox = () => {
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);

  useEffect(() => {
    setIsLoaded(true); // Triggers once JS is active
  }, []);

  return (
    <div class={css({
      // Red on server (SEO/LCP friendly), Blue once interactive!
      background: isLoaded ? 'blue' : 'red',
      transition: 'background 0.5s',
      padding: '20px'
    })}>
      {isLoaded ? 'I am Interactive!' : 'I am Static HTML'}
    </div>
  );
};

```

### Key Benefits

* **No FOUC (Flash of Unstyled Content):** Since the "Server Side" style is already in the static CSS, there's no flickering.
* **Unlimited Flexibility:** Need to change colors based on user input or mouse position? Just pass the props/state to css() like you always do.
* **Zero Learning Curve:** If you know how to use useEffect and Emotion, you already know how to build dynamic Islands with Potate.


## 🛠 The Patterns 

In Potate, we refer to reusable CSS logic as "The Patterns".

Honestly? They’re just standard JavaScript functions that return styles. No complex registration, no hidden magic. You just write a function, and that's it. Simple, right? 🤤

### LinkOverlay

You can easily implement the LinkOverlay pattern. This expands a link's clickable area to its nearest parent with `position: relative`.

```jsx
import { css } from '@emotion/css';

const linkOverlay = (...args) => css({
  '&::before': {
    content: '""',
    position: 'absolute',
    top: 0,
    left: 0,
    width: '100%',
    height: '100%',
    zIndex: 0,
  },
}, ...args);

export const Card = () => (
  // The parent must have position: relative
  <div class={css({ position: 'relative', border: '1px solid #ccc', padding: '1rem' })}>
    <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/150" alt="placeholder" />
    <h3>Card Title</h3>
    <a href="/details" class={linkOverlay()}>
      View more
    </a>
  </div>
);

```

## 🛠 Advanced

### Styled Components (MUI-like)

If you prefer the Styled Components pattern (popularized by libraries like MUI or styled-components), Potate makes it incredibly easy to implement.

Even with this sophisticated API, the result remains the same: Zero-Runtime CSS. All styles are pre-calculated during SSR and extracted into static CSS files.

```jsx
import {css, keyframes, injectGlobal, cx} from '@emotion/css'
import * as patterns from './my-patterns'

export const styled = (Tag, options) => (style, ...values) => props => {
  const makeClassName = (style, ...values) =>
    typeof style == 'function' ? makeClassName(style(props)) : css(style, ...values);
 
  const {sx, 'class': _class, children, ...wosx} = props;

  Object.keys(wosx).forEach(key => {
    if (options && options.shouldForwardProp && !options.shouldForwardProp(key)) {
      delete wosx[key];
    }
  });

  const newProps = {
    ...wosx,
    'class': cx(makeClassName(style, ...values), makeClassName(sx), _class),
  };

  return (<Tag {...newProps}>{children}</Tag>);
};

```

> **Note:** What is the sx prop? For those unfamiliar with libraries like [MUI, the sx prop](https://mui.com/system/getting-started/the-sx-prop/) is a popular pattern that allows you to apply "one-off" styles directly to a component.
>
> In this implementation, the sx prop is merged with the component's base styles. This gives you the flexibility to tweak margins or colors on a specific instance without needing to define a new styled component every time.
